This repository is supplementary information to a neuroevolution project that I had done in Simbrain 4.0 with Professor Jeffrey Yoshimi at UC Merced. It contains 12 example simulations of data collected through systematic analysis and collection. The simulations with highest fitness values will have the best performance. The simulations are tagged with a respective tag like _HCM_ or _LCM_ that describes the agent's movement when near food objects.
